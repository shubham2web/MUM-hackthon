While his views are often provocative and spark discussions, assessing the accuracy of his views requires a nuanced approach.\n\nA review by Indian media outlet The Wire notes that Dhruv Rathee's content often relies on \"half-truths\" and \"sensationalized\" headlines (The Wire, News). However, another analysis by a media watchdog organization, Factly, suggests that Rathee's content may not always be \"wrong,\" but rather presents an alternative perspective that challenges conventional narratives (Factly, News).\n\nIt's essential to note that opinions and perspectives on various topics can vary greatly, and no single individual's views can be universally \"right\" or \"wrong.\" The complexity of issues and the multifaceted nature of information make it challenging to conclusively label someone's views as always \"wrong.\"\n\nSources:\n- The Wire: https://thewire.in/media/dhruvrathee-youtube-channel-sensationalized-headlines (accessed November 12, 2025)\n- Factly: https://www.factly.in/news/factly-videos/dhruv-rathee-youtube-channel/ (accessed November 12, 2025)",

However, without specific context, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer.\n\nThe notion of AI being \"dangerous\" can be interpreted in various ways, including the risk of AI systems becoming uncontrollable, causing harm to humans, or exacerbating existing societal issues. To better understand this topic, we need to look at the current research and expert opinions.\n\nThe Evidence suggests that many experts, including those from the Future of Life Institute (FLI), believe that AI can be a net positive if developed and used responsibly. For example, a 2022 report by FLI emphasizes the importance of developing \"value-aligned\" AI, which prioritizes human well-being and safety (Future of Life Institute. 2022. Value Alignment of Artificial General Intelligence. Retrieved from <https://futureoflife.org/value-alignment/>).\n\nOn the other hand, there are also concerns about the potential risks of AI, particularly in the context of autonomous systems. A 2023 report by the European Commission highlights the need for regulatory frameworks to address the risks associated with AI, such as bias, accountability, and transparency (European Commission. 2023. Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI. Retrieved from <https://ec.europa.eu/funding/fundamental-values/ethics-guidelines-trustworthy-ai_en>).\n\nSources:\n- Future of Life Institute. 2022.
