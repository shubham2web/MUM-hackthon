# ATLAS – Authentic Truth Layer Assessment System — Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview
ATLAS is an engineering-ready, multi-agent AI debate system designed to minimize bias and increase transparency in automated reasoning. It extends the "committee of AIs" paradigm using role-reversal rounds, diversified sources, an adversarial Bias Auditor, evidence grounding, iterative convergence, and transparent synthesis mechanisms. The system is optimized for auditable, balanced, and fair conclusions in high-stakes or contentious queries.

---

## 2. Goals & Objectives
- Reduce cultural/training-data bias in AI-mediated debates.
- Surface edge cases and underrepresented perspectives.
- Deliver balanced, auditable, and actionable outputs.
- Enable transparency and user inspection into provenance and bias.
- Build infrastructure suitable for evaluation and iterative improvement.

---

## 3. Target Users
- **Primary:** Researchers, policy analysts, journalists, and organizations needing balanced AI reasoning.
- **Secondary:** Domain experts, debate moderators, product teams working on explainable AI.

  > As an end user, I want to see multiple perspectives debated, with explicit identification of roles and evidence for each stance.
- **Backend:** Agent Manager orchestrates round structure; handles timeouts and retries.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  - [ ] Each debate involves 4+ roles with labeled responses.
  - [ ] Agents receive prompt-specific instructions and evidence slices.
- **Owners:** AI/Platform/Backend.

---

### 4.2 Pluggable Model Interface
**Purpose:** Integrate multiple language model providers (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, etc.) for agent diversity and fallback.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  - [ ] System can swap agent LLMs at config level.
  - [ ] Latency per agent call <15s in majority of runs.
- **Owners:** Backend/AI.

---

### 4.3 Evidence Grounder & Source Diversification
**Purpose:** Retrieve and bundle evidence from diverse, global sources.  
- **Backend:** Evidence Grounder gathers 5–20 evidence items (news, research, datasets) per query; tags with provenance & metadata.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  - [ ] ≥4 source categories represented in evidence bundle.
  - [ ] Provenance (origin, language, date, type) traceable for every evidence summary.
- **Owners:** Data/Backend.

---

### 4.4 Bias Auditor System
**Purpose:** Audit debate rounds to flag bias, gaps, overconfidence, and lack of citations.  
- **Pipeline:**  
  Auditor reads agent turns and evidence, outputs actionable flags and rationale.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  - [ ] ≥80% of turns annotated with Auditor notes in MVP.
  - [ ] Specific flags (overrepresented domain, missing region) visibly logged.
- **Owners:** AI/Auditing.

---

### 4.5 Role Reversal & Convergence Rounds
**Purpose:** Force agents to argue the opposite of initial stances and/or adopt new personas, surfacing hidden assumptions and edge cases.  
- **Implementation:** Role Reversal Engine issues new instructions leveraging original evidence.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  - [ ] All initial agents produce a reversed or alternate round.
  - [ ] Convergence round logs clearly distinguish between original and reversed arguments.
- **Owners:** AI/Platform.

---

### 4.6 Moderator & Transparent Synthesis
**Purpose:** Moderator module creates final synthesis, surfacing consensus, disputed points, a recommendation, and bias/coverage notes.  
- **UI/Backend:** Moderation step outputs provenance and confidence scoring for user inspection.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  - [ ] Synthesis includes explicit provenance map and bias summary.
- **Owners:** AI/Frontend.

---

### 4.7 Audit Log & User Interface (Transparency)
**Purpose:** Expose debate transcript, agents, evidence, and Auditor flags interactively.  
- **Frontend:** Expand/collapse turns, provenance overlay, bias dashboard.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  - [ ] UI allows per-claim inspection (who said what, using which citation).
  - [ ] Bias dashboard summarizes audit output and source diversity.
- **Owners:** Frontend/Design.

---

## 5. Technical Requirements

### Data & Storage
- Postgres or MongoDB → Conversation, audit, and provenance logs.
- Blob/Document storage → Evidence excerpts and transcripts.
- Redis/RabbitMQ → Asynchronous agent orchestration, timeouts, and retries.

### Auth & Security
- API key and RBAC support.
- Conversation and audit logs encrypted at rest/in transit.
- Secrets manager for model/provider credentials.

### Analytics & Metrics
- Diversity score (source region/domain fraction).
- Contradiction ratio tracking across debate rounds.
- Audit coverage (percent turns annotated).
- Human evaluation scoring (fairness, utility, transparency).

---

## 6. Milestones & MVP Scope
**MVP Scope:**
- [ ] Model Interface Layer with 1 provider and fallback.
- [ ] Core Agent Manager and conversation store.
- [ ] Role Prompt Library with 4–6 roles.

## 8. Privacy & Compliance
- User queries anonymized in logs.
- Explicit consent required for audit storage/sharing.
- Right to delete and export conversations/audit records.
- GDPR/CCPA readiness.

- [ ] Moderator outputs always include a provenance map and bias summary.

Hackathon Enhancements & Use Case
Example Use Case for Demo Impact
To illustrate ATLAS's value in a hackathon setting, the system could be demonstrated debating a topical high-stakes issue — for example, analyzing arguments on AI regulation policies, climate change strategies, or vaccine hesitancy. Each AI agent presents evidence-backed stances from different regional, cultural, or ideological perspectives, explicitly citing sources. The moderator then synthesizes a balanced summary that highlights consensus and contentious points, exposing blind spots and biases for the audience.

Human-in-the-Loop Feedback
An optional feature in the UI lets human reviewers flag biased or incorrect agent statements during debates. These flags feed back to the auditor or can prompt human moderator review, ensuring ongoing ethical oversight and iterative improvement during and after hackathon runs.

Robustness & Error Handling
The system includes fallback strategies if agents deadlock or fail to generate arguments, such as automatic retries, switching language model providers, or alerting the moderator. This ensures a smooth demo experience and demonstrates system resilience to judges.

Evidence Verification Prospects
While current MVP focuses on retrieving diverse evidence, future iterations could integrate credibility scoring algorithms or third-party fact-checking APIs to minimize misinformation amplification. This forward-looking approach can be called out as a planned extension.

Extensibility & API Integration
ATLAS is designed with a plug-and-play architecture allowing integration of additional AI models, specialized auditor plugins, and external data sources. This openness encourages hackathon teams or judges to envision creative extensions or real-world deployments.

Accessibility Considerations
The UI design includes plans for accessibility features such as keyboard navigation, color contrast compliance, screen reader compatibility, and clear labeling to make the system usable by a wide audience, aligning with ethical AI principles.
