# ATLAS Development To-Do List

## Core Features
- [x] **Multi-Agent Structured Debate**: Integrated with Groq and HuggingFace APIs.
- [x] **Evidence Grounder & Diversification**: Successfully gathers evidence with provenance metadata.
- [x] **Bias Auditor System**: Flags bias and gaps in evidence.
- [ ] **Role Reversal & Convergence Rounds**: Implement functionality to reverse agent roles and log alternate arguments.
- [x] **Moderator & Transparent Synthesis**: Synthesis includes provenance and bias summaries.
- [x] **Audit Log & User Interface**: Functional UI with transcript visualization and bias dashboard.

## MVP Scope
- [x] **Model Interface Layer**: Integrated with Groq and HuggingFace.
- [x] **Core Agent Manager**: Functional; orchestrates AI agents and evidence gathering.
- [ ] **Role Prompt Library**: Define prompts for 4â€“6 roles with distinct personas or perspectives.
- [x] **Evidence Grounder Prototype**: Successfully implemented.
- [x] **Bias Auditor**: Functional; flags bias and gaps in evidence.
- [ ] **Role Reversal Engine**: Implement functionality for role reversal.
- [x] **Moderator & Synthesis Output**: Functional; synthesis includes provenance and bias summaries.
- [x] **UI with Transcript & Bias Dashboard**: Functional; logs confirm user interaction with endpoints.
